\maketitle

Given a dictionary containing strings of 5 letters, guess the dictionary element
as quickly as possible, in no more than 6 guesses.

At any point in the game, the probability of successfully guessing the word is
one over the number of feasible words remaining in the list.  Thus the optimal
guess is the remaining word that would eliminate as many other words as
possible.

The ideal word contains a letter contained by half the words on the list.

Two letter patterns can also be used.  'ch', 'sh', or 'ly', 'oo'

Algorithm:
Choose the best letter.  Find all words containing that letter.  Repeat.
